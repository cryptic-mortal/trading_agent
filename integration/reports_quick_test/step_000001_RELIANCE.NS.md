# Combined Weight Review: RELIANCE.NS

- **As of:** 2025-11-06
- **Assigned Weight:** 12.96%
- **News Lookback:** 7 day(s)

## Unified Summary
- Revenue growth of 10% justifies a significant, but not overweight, position.
- Sub-par Profit Margin (8.31%) and ROE (9.72%) suggest the current weight may be slightly high.
- The single negative news headline, while relevant, is not sufficient to warrant a major weight reduction.
- A dividend yield of 37% may signal financial distress, or an unsustainable payout ratio, which needs further investigation.
- Relative outperformance during a market dip (as implied by Reuters) provides some support for the existing weight.
- A P/E ratio of 24.10 indicates Reliance is trading at a premium, which may imply the existing weight may be too high.
