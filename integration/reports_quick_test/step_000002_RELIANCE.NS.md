# Combined Weight Review: RELIANCE.NS

- **As of:** 2025-11-07
- **Assigned Weight:** 17.29%
- **News Lookback:** 7 day(s)

## Unified Summary
- Sustained revenue growth of 10.00% supports the current allocation, reflecting business momentum.
- The high dividend yield of 37.00% makes the stock attractive for income, justifying the weight.
- Profit Margin (8.31%) and ROE (9.72%) are adequate but don't strongly justify an overweight position given prevailing market conditions and sector performance considerations.
- Dominance in the Indian market, as evidenced by its role in offsetting losses during market consolidation, necessitates a significant portfolio weight.
- The negative news headline ("Indian stock benchmarks consolidate lower; Reliance offsets some losses") is not company-specific, suggesting a broader market trend, thus the weight can be maintained.
- A high P/E ratio of 24.10 suggests the stock might be overvalued, and the negative news sentiment slightly challenges the current overweight allocation.
